G-CARE is a modern financial assessment tool designed to help lenders, analysts, and financial professionals understand a customer’s affordability and credit risk in a clean, structured, and globally adaptable way.

It combines thoughtful UX, smart financial logic, and global credit-risk principles (inspired by Basel III and IFRS 9) to create a simple but powerful engine that works for any country, any currency, and any financial organisation.

G-CARE is not just a calculator — it is a fully interactive decisioning tool that evaluates income, expenses, debt behaviour, risk signals, and potential restructuring paths. It’s built for real-world use, and it’s designed to give both clarity and direction.





Why I Built G-CARE

Financial assessments today often feel outdated, overly complicated, or rigid. Many tools are locked to a single country or institution. Others overwhelm users with technical jargon without giving meaningful insights.

G-CARE was designed to fix that.

The goal was simple:

Make financial assessments universal

Make them visually intuitive

Make them actionable

Make them human

Whether you are a lender, advisor, analyst, or consumer, G-CARE provides clear insight into a client’s financial world and the options available to them.
